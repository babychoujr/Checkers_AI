 A Checkers AI bot utilizes the simple Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm. The algorithm exploits the Law of Large Numbers to provide the bot with enough information to play a educated move through randomized simulations. The bot plays the best move for the current player based on the current state of the board.
